# WareHouse Capstone Project
Codecademy Pro-Intensive | June 13, 2018

## Introduction 
WareHouse is a fake company imagined by Codecademy for the final project of the Build Website UIs Pro Intensive course. The purpose of this project is to combine studies in Accessibility, Color Theory, Typography, CSS Grid, and layouts to design a functioning site to please any future and current make-believe shoppers. 

## Overview
The website was redesigned to meet accessibility expectations. To fix the layout, I added more color and more layout features to really make the site stand out on all media screens.

A copy of Task 1 of this Capstone Project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIJ-hLm4YKNV9MwbuE5HKrqas3wks1StLgSQe081fyU/edit?usp=sharing). This was shared on slack for peer feedback.

Additional Features: 
* Responsive design among all pages built to work with all screens.
* Animated banner on the front page that helps brand warehouse more in `index.html`
* A working "show more" or "show less" button in `products.html`
* Fake cart that pretends to remove items in `cart.html`
* Added a few extra pages to the site like `help.html`

## Fonts
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) used: 
* Oswald
* PT Sans 700
* Roboto Condensed
